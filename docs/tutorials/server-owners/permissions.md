Permissions
====
Before reading this tutorial, please make sure you understand the basic permission system of sponge.
You can read [this (server owners)](https://docs.spongepowered.org/stable/en/server/management/permissions.html) and [this (developers)](https://docs.spongepowered.org/stable/en/plugin/permissions.html) on the sponge docs to better understand permissions.<br>

## Finding permissions
This is automatically generated information for the latest release.
Click on a certain module or command will give you the permissions of that module or command. For a list of all permissions, click on the third link.
* [A list of all modules](../../modules.md)<br>
* [A list of all commands](../../commands.md)<br>
* [A list of all permissions](../../permissions.md)<br> 

## Automatically setting up permissions
You can let UltimateCore automatically set up the permissions for me.<br>
Use the command: `/uc setupperms <Level> <Group>`<br>

The level is the set of permissions you want to give to the player. These sets are premade in UltimateCore, you just have to enter the name. To see which permissions are part of a set, look [here](../../permissions.md). You can choose from: `Everyone, Vip, Mod, Admin, Owner, Nobody and Unspecified.`

The second argument, the group, is the identifier of the group you want to give these permissions. Make sure you create the group first!
