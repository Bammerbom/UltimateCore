Permissions
====
Before reading this tutorial, please make sure you understand the basic permission system of sponge.
You can read [this (server owners)](https://docs.spongepowered.org/stable/en/server/management/permissions.html) and [this (developers)](https://docs.spongepowered.org/stable/en/plugin/permissions.html) on the sponge docs to better understand permissions.<br>

## Finding permissions
This is automatically generated information for the latest release.
Click on a certain module or command will give you the permissions of that module or command. For a list of all permissions, click on the third link.
* [A list of all modules](../../modules.md)<br>
* [A list of all commands](../../commands.md)<br>
* [A list of all permissions](../../permissions.md)<br> 

## Automatically setting up permissions
This is still an work in progress feature, and can't currently be done.<br>
I will add this feature relatively soon.
